		The first user is to be considered the default user and it should match a
		common account for all the mirrors.
		For convenience, and because the mirror list will probably be generated
		automatically which will make more difficult to specify a specific account
		per mirror as explained below, alternative user accounts can be listed 
		below. When the access is not granted for the default user, then the
		program will try an alternative user account. Adding random user accounts
		will greatly decrease the performance, you have been warned.
		
		Any user node contains either a passwd element or a dsakey element for 
		authentication purposes. If the user node misses the inner authentication node
		it will be interpreted as an empty password (the same when the passwd attribute
		is missing).
		
		The attribute realname is optional.
