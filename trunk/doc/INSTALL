INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
1) required software: Berkeley DB XML
   Follow the instructions to build this software from source.
   http://www.sleepycat.com/xmldocs/
   
   You would probably run this from the root of the uncompressed directory:
   ./buildall.sh --enable-java --prefix=/usr/local/dbxml-2.2.13   -b 64
   
   (Remove "-b 64" if you build for 32-bit)
   
   WARNING
   -------
   There is a know bug crashing the Java VM. It is due to unproper compilation
   of the java bindings. To get around that modify the configure files
   to set -O0 instead of -O2 (no optimization).
   
2) Pass the above directory to the JRE when launching the program:
   -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/dbxml-2.2.13/lib 
   
   For example,
   ------------
   mirror-monitor$ java \
   			-cp bin:.:lib/dom4j-1.6.1.jar:lib/db.jar:lib/dbxml.jar:lib/ganymed-ssh2-build208-beta2.jar:lib/commons-net-1.4.0.jar:lib/oro-2.0.8.jar \
   			-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/dbxml-2.2.13/lib examples/bdbxml/MirrorStatusViaFTP     
   			
   (or configure LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
   
3) WEB SERVER
   Mount the web directory with an Apache Alias directive (or according to your
   web server).
   
   Description of the output
   -------------------------
   1) web/diff 
   		. contains the diffs (ie mirror status when compared to the master) as XML files
   		. these files contain a processing instruction pointing to a XSL stylesheet (see below)
   		. Mozilla/Firefox can display them directly (it does a client XSLT transformation on the XML),
   			but other browsers can't (such as konqueror)
   			
   2) web/xsl
   		. contains the XSL stylesheets for transformation of the XML documents into HTML for the browswer
   		. must be accessible by the browser (Mozilla/Firefox would query it)
   		. the produced HTML contains a "link" to a predetermined CSS stylesheet
   		
   3) web/css
   		. contains the CSS stylesheets to present the HTML page
   		. should be customized by corporate "clients" such as Mandriva to integrate with their web site
   		. should be obviously accessible by the browsers (all of them support CSS, or almost)
   		
   4) web/dtd
   		. contains the DTDs
   		. should be accessible from the web (not mandatory for now)
   		
   5) web/html
   		. contains pre-computed html pages for the non-XSLT-capable browser (the majority)
   		. these pages are produced from web/diff or web/delta XML data transformed with their
   			respective XSL stylesheet in web/xsl
